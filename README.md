"HR Data Analysis Dashboard" using Power BI!

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover key insights related to employee demographics, attrition, performance, and more.📑

I used Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing, SQL for data extraction and transformation, and finally Power BI to build an interactive dashboard with rich visualizations.📊

The goal was to make HR decision-making more data-driven and efficient.📈

📍Key features include employee:-
 "Attrition by Education","Job satisfaction", "Attrition by salary","Attrition by job role" and also by age and most importantly "Year at Company".

This project strengthened my skills in data handling, business intelligence, and storytelling through visuals.
